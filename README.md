Northcoders news is an API created to serve news articles on a range of topics. These articles have comments associated with them, along with user information linked to these comments. In addition to the 'GET' methods on various endpoints the API has POST methods available to allow data to be added to files, along with PATCH methods to amend data, such as altering votes for articles up/down. Files can also be removed using the DELETE method.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a text editor such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text or Atom in which to develop the project.
In addition, you will need have MongoDB installed on your machine. For futher information see https://www.mongodb.com

To begin you will need to clone the project from this project repository:
To do this, click on the forkclone/download button and copy the following link provided:`$ git clone https://github.com/RachGriff/BE2-northcoders-news`
In your terminal, navigate to the directory in which you wish to save your project, and then enter:

\$ git clone //paste in copied link here.

Next, use the 'cd' command to navigate into the project folder, and open the project.

### Installing

#Step 1:

\$npm install this will install the packages required.

This will create a basic package.json which can then be added to to meet the needs of the project.
These will include:
For this project you will need to install a number of key packages:

*dependencies:
body-parser
express
mongoose
*devDependencies:
chai
mocha
nodemon
supertest

#Step 2:

Config file set up:
Create a config folder and within this an index.js file.
Create a variable in which you set the environment to 'development':
`const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || "development`. This will need to be exported at the bottom of the page as follows:
`module.exports = config[env];`
The different environments will need to be set up with the correct DB URL as follows:

`test: {DB_URL: "mongodb://localhost:27017/northcoders_news_test" }, development: {DB_URL: "mongodb://localhost:27017/northcoders_news" },`
This means that for testing we can use localhost but for production, we will utilise heroku.

#Step 3:
Run the command `npm run seed` to seed the database.

Now you will be able to access the database using the command line. Here are some useful commands:
use northcoders_news//accesses the development database
use northcoders_news_test//accesses the test database
show dbs
show collections
db.<'insert collection name'>find().pretty()//returns contents of the search

#Step 4:

Using the command `npm run dev` will initialise the server.
To access the data in the browser:
enter http://localhost:9090/api/

This will bring up an html page listing the possible endpoints served.

From here you can enter these endpoints to access the data:

        GET /api/topics
        #Get all the topics.

        example data return:
        {
        "topics": [
        {
        "\_id": "5bddbd22b1195c1b2e6ebdba",
        "title": "Coding",
        "slug": "coding",
        "\_\_v": 0
        },

        GET /api/topics/:topic_slug/articles
        # Return all the articles for a certain topic
        # e.g: `/api/topics/football/articles`

        GET /api/articles
        # Returns all the articles

        example of data return for the above endpoints:

### Testing

In the spec file are a suite of tests designed to ensure that the functionaltiy of the api works as expected, and that errors are handled in a way that provides information to the user.

To run the tests:

Seed the database using npm run seed.
Then use the command npm run test.
